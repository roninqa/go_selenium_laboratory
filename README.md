# Selenium Go
```
  This is my playground for Testing & Selenium tests automation in Go.
```

## My Notes
```
  1. Run your version of the .jar. e.g., java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar  
  2. Now, use the command "go test". This will run all tests in the folder. Test in Go are specific. 
  You must write tests in a certain way. Notice Example_test.go. This test file is denoted with "_test". 
  Test methods starts with "func TestSelenium(t *testing.T)". More reading here, https://golang.org/pkg/testing/.
