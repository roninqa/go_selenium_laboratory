#Selenium Go
```
  This is my playground for Testing & Selenium tests automation in Go. I'm applying my new found knowledge of creating websites using HTML, CSS, & GO. Also, I'll work on more advance testing with api's, CI/CD, AWS, and MongoDB in the future. I hope to grow this repo and I hope it'll help others learn as well.
```

###My Notes
```
  1. Run your version of the .jar. e.g., java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.24.1.jar  
  2. Now, use the command "go test". This will run all tests in the folder. Test in Go are specific. 
  You must write tests in a certain way. Notice Example_test.go. This test file is denoted with "_test". 
  Test methods starts with "func TestSelenium(t *testing.T)". More reading here, https://golang.org/pkg/testing/.
